Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may be a self-contoured gathering of spatially distributed and firm sensors with less framework that monitor and record the physical conditions of the surroundings and cooperatively  pass the data through the network to a central location or sink wherever the data is noticed and analyzed.
Underwater environment is a demanding factor in the monitoring of underwater, coastal protection, disasters and military supervision, and much else. Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks  (UWSNs) have a crucial role to play. 
The multi-channel propagation, small bandwidth available, a long propagation delay, small energy resources and dynamic topology Present many difficulties for these networks.
Many routing protocols have been designed to address these problems and further improve the performance of the existing protocols.
A secure and speedy routing protocol is proposed in this work.
The number of Potential forwarding nodes (PFNs) of the forwarder node and the shortest path from the forwarder to the closest sink are taken into account.
The PFNs of the forwarder also limits the prevention of void hole. In certain areas of the network with a high traffic density, two sinks are used to lower the network latency.
Subject to a distance between them and the transmission range, forwarders can pick their next destination from the sink node to the next neighboring node.
The results of simulations suggest that the protocol is confirmed by a high packet delivery ratio (PDR), a lower end-to-end delay (E2ED) and a high throughput.

Methodology 

The proposed reliable and expeditious routing protocol offers various advantages and also suffers from some flaws. Void holes are avoided, PDR and throughput are improved by considering PFNs, but at the same time E2ED is increased. 
Considering greater transmission range and more number of nodes increase the efficiency but this comes at the expense of increasing E2ED. 

High delivery ratio and low E2ED is achieved by the embedded sinks feature, however, high communication with the surface sinks is recorded. 

Overall, this protocol achieved improved throughput, improved PDR, and decreased packet drop at the cost of E2ED. Packet drop is decreased and consequently, PDR is improved by selecting high node density path for forwarding at the same time. Throughput is also increased due to this.
